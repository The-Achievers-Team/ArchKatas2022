# Assumptions

Our design and decision has been made based on the following assumptions:

* Civilians CANNOT make donation with their points
* For every transaction there will be 5% retailer fee 
* Transactions will happen on Retailers end, not within Hey Blue
* You can ONLY redeem your hey, Blue points to buy goods 
* We will only accept .gov/.org email for police officers profile creation.
* For push notification to work user must have location and notification turned on for the app
* Affiliate marketing assumptions: once the Civilian has decided on a purchase with Hey Blue points, they attach their rewards membership card associated with the retailer they’re purchasing from (if they have one) and click “Buy”.  That sends a request externally to the retailer which will include a transaction ID and a code that Hey Blue uses to get the 5% back from their affiliate link that was clicked.  What Hey   Blue expects back is a response with the 5% that we then allocate between Admin costs for the App and a   Community Fund for the zip code where the purchase was made from. 
* Police officer doesn't have to connect to the charity to make a donation to that particular charity. 
* One suggested feature was that a Police Officer could donate their HB points to a particular family that is serviced by their charity of choice.  We assume the Charity cannot share details about their recipients so this feature could be implemented by the Charity on their site and decide how much information they want to share about the charity recipients
