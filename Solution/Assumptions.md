# Assumptions

Our design and decision has been made based on the following assumptions:

* Civilians CANNOT make donation with their points
* For every transaction there will be 5% retailer fee 
* Transactions will happen on Retailers end, not within Hey Blue
* You can ONLY redeem your hey, Blue points to buy goods 
* We will only accept .gov/.org email for police officers profile creation.
* For push notification to work user must have location and notification turned on for the app
* Affiliate marketing assumptions: once the Civilian has decided on a purchase with Hey Blue points, they attach their rewards membership card associated with the retailer they’re purchasing from (if they have one) and click “Buy”.  That sends a request externally to the retailer which will include a transaction ID and a code that Hey Blue uses to get the 5% back from their affiliate link that was clicked.  What Hey   Blue expects back is a response with the 5% that we then allocate between Admin costs for the App and a   Community Fund for the zip code where the purchase was made from. 
* Police officer doesn't have to connect to the charity to make a donation to that particular charity.
