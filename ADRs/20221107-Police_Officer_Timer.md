Decision: Police officer timer will be refreshed with a new 15 minutes when they log back into the application. 

Decision Date: November 7th, 2022

Pros:

1. Reduced complexity for the police officers. 
2. Increased opportunities to connect with civilians.

Cons:

1. Additional application complexity for always keeping track of timer and needing to refresh it. 

Justification: We feel that the benefit of the timer being refreshed when they log back in will simplify the application as well as adhere to the objective of connecting police officers to civilians.
