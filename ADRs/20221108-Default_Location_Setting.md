Decision: The default setting of geo-location functionality will be disabled.

Decision Date: November 8th, 2022

Pros:

1. Security: Ensures proper security and safety for police officers and civilians. 

Cons:

1. User Experience: Will be more complex user experience to enable geo-location. 
2. Architecture: Additional step in the flow to prompt user to enable geo-location

Justification: We feel that the benefits of this default behavior will improve the security of users using the Hey Blue Application.
