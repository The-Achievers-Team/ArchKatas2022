Decision: The default setting of geo-location enabled will be set when push notifications are opted-in for. 

Pros:

1. Improves user experience for the users by simplifying the connectivity process. 
2. Reduces application complexity by consolidating it into one flow when push notifications are opted-in for. 

Cons:

1. Default setting could be seen as invasive. 

Justification: We feel that the benefits of this default behavior will improve the goal of the application of connecting police officers to civilians. The cons will be outweighed by the ability for the user to opt-out of the default setting.
